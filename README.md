# RICOH_SP-204_Toner-Chip-Reset

# Acknowledgement

I'd like to thank Ludovic Guegan (lugu), from whom I copied the base for this work, 
for inspiring me to do experiment with my printers (RICOH Aficio SP-204) toner chip 
model and be able to reset it effectively. It has been a great learning experience 
on how the I2C protocol works and how to manipulate I2C EEPROMS.

# Introduction

The RICOH SP 204 printer toners have a chip that keeps track of the number of pages that have been printed.
This is anoying because it will render a refill useless.

In order to reuse this kind of toner, there are two things you need to do:

1. refill the toner with ink (if needed)
2. reset the toner chip (or replace it)

There is [plenty of information](www.uni-kit.com/pdf/tonerrefillinstructions.pdf) explaining how to refill the
toner but little information on how to erase the toner chip.

This document deals with the second point: how to dump the chip and
reset it.

It took me a while to get everything setup and to have my toner chip
reset so I would like to share this process in order to help other to
do the same with their printer toner cartridges.

I will step through the process of understanding the problem, analysing the
chip circuit, dumping the chip contents and writing back a pattern so the 
printer will be able to initialize the chip and set the toner level to full.




# The problem

My computer talks to the SP-204 printer via an Ethernet link.
The printer communicates with the toner chip via the I2C bus.

	+------------+           +-----------+            +-------------+
	|    Host    |    ETH    |           |    I2C     |    toner    |
	|  computer  | <-------> |  Printer  | <--------> |    chip     |
	|            |           |           |            |             |
	+------------+           +-----------+            +-------------+

What I did is connect an Arduino Pro mini directly to the toner
chip like this:

	+-----------+          +-----------+
	|           |   I2C    |   toner   |
	|  Arduino  | <------> |   chip    |
	|           |          |           |
	+-----------+          +-----------+


The I2C bus is very common on embedded systems.
For example: smartphones use it to connect the touchscreen or the motion sensors
to the main processor chip. There is plenty of documentation available on the Internet.
I recommend this one:
[Learn I2C / from Saleae](https://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005987106-Learn-I2C-Inter-Integrated-Circuit).

The full specification is avavailable at: [http://www.i2c-bus.org](http://www.i2c-bus.org)

# The toner chip module

To do this it is necessary to know what I2C EEPROM is used in the circuit.
Try to gather as much information as you can:

* Read the part number and search it on the Internet.
* Search if other people have shared information about your printer.

The IC you see in the front side of the toner chip seems to be an EEPROM memory.
This has been confirmed by the following blogs discussing other RICOH printer models:

* http://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/369267
* https://esdblog.org/ricoh-sp-c250dn-laser-printer-toner-hack/

Looking at the chip with a magnifying glass and slanted lighting I could read
a partialy erased designation text "L02W". This chip turns out to be a 
BR24L02W EEPROM, the equivalent of the 24C02 EEPROM.

The rest of this tutorial will deal with the process of reading and writing this EEPROM
memory chip.

# Determining the I2C clock freq. and device address

To communicate on an I2C bus, we need to know the correct clock speed and the
EEPROM device address.

If you know the EEPROM model from the circuit analysis, you can
read the datasheet and find the clock rate and address like this:

For example the [datasheet for the BR24L02-W](datasheet/BR24Lxxx-W-EEPROM.pdf)
indicates a max. clock freq. of 400KHz for Vcc > 2.5Vdc.

The datasheet indicates how to calculate the address according to the logic level
present on pins: A0, A1 & A2. In binary, the address is computed like this:
`1 0 1 0 A2 A1 A0`

As can be seen on the front side of the chip module the hardwired levels are:

```
	A0 = 1
	A1 = 1
	A2 = 0
```
The deice address is therefore: `1 0 1 0 0 1 1 (0x53)`.


# Regarding the Arduino sketches

I have modified both Arduino sketches published by Ludovic for usage of the extEEPROM library!
I have added a menu to the Toner_chip_reset.ino so you can decide if you first want to
dump the contents of the chip module.
I modified Multispeed_I2C_scanner.ino to scan up to a max. I2C clock of 1MHz.

Here you can read a [discussion](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/29457/how-to-make-arduino-do-high-speed-i2c) on the subject of High speed I2C using the Arduino.

If you don't know the max. clock freq. and the device address on the I2C
bus you can scan all the possible I2C addresses at different clock
frequencies. The Multispeed_I2C_scaner.ino will help you to do this.
Here is the output of the program execution on my Arduino:

```
   Arduino MultiSpeed I2C Scanner - 0.1.7
   
   I2C ports: 1
   	@ = toggle Wire - Wire1 - Wire2 [TEENSY 3.5 or Arduino Due]
   Scanmode:
   	s = single scan
   	c = continuous scan - 1 second delay
   	q = quit continuous scan
   	d = toggle latency delay between successful tests. 0 - 5 ms
   Output:
   	p = toggle printAll - printFound.
   	h = toggle header - noHeader.
   	a = toggle address range, 0..127 - 8..120
   Speeds:
   	0 =  50 - 1MHz
   	1 =  100 KHz only
   	2 =  200 KHz only
   	4 =  400 KHz only
   	8 =  800 KHz only
   	9 = 1000 KHz only
   
   	? = help - this page
   
   TIME	 DEC	HEX     50  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  1000  [KHz]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   30148  83	0x53	  V   V    V    V    V    V    V    V    V    V
   
   1 devices found in 606 milliseconds.
```

Now we know the device address on the I2C bus is 0x53 and it 
responds to SCL from 50 kHz to 1 MHz.

Note: the BR24L02-W spec-sheet states that the max. SCL for 2.5Vdc <= Vcc =>  5.5 Vdc 
should not exceed 400 KHz!
Therefore, I have used 400 KHz as the clock frequency for I2C bus access.


# Reading the EEPROM contents

Since we know how to communicate with the chip, let's read the content
of the memory.

The datasheet for the [BR24Lxxx-W](datasheet/BR24Lxxx-W-EEPROM.pdf) EEPROM explains how to perform a read operation:

- master send start condition
- master send eeprom address + read bit
- master send data address
- master send start condition
- master send eeprom address + read bit
- device respond with data
- master send stop condition

   A STOP condition is mandatory between writes!
   Write cycle: 5 ms.

The contents of the original toner chip after my printer started to complain 
about low toner level was:
```
    000: 21 00 01 03 03 01 01 00  00 00 34 30 37 32 35 35  |!.........407255|

    0f0: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  |................|
```
Here we can see:

* there seems to be a header (0x0 to 0x0f),
* followed by some numbers (0x10 to 0x1f),
* followed by the printer ID (T773M801120),
* followed by some other unknown values.

This does not make much sense. The next step is to figure out what
those values are for.

# Trying some variations of the EEPROM contents

If you are lucky enough that your toner chip is still working (printing), 
you can dump the content of the EEPROM before and after printing a
page. This might give you clues about the EEPROM memory usage.

The process is like this:

* read the EEPROM content,
* make some changes base on a hypothesis,
* write the content into the EEPROM,
* try to print a page and restart if this does not work.

In order to speed up the process and not have to remove/reapply the chip to the toner 
cartridge every time, I directly connected my Arduino to the chip on the toner while resetting it.

![Picture: Direct connect to the toner cartridge](images/ConnectingToTheTonerCartridge.jpg)


After experimenting a bit I decided to only include the  first 7 (0x00 - 0x06) bytes from the original chip dump.
The rest of the first half of the chip contents are set to 0x00! The second half is not used.

It turned out to work: my printer restarts and the tonner level indicator is at 100%.

Here is are the contents of the header arry used to reset the chip:

    unsigned char chip_reset[] = {
      0x21, 0x00, 0x01, 0x03, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
